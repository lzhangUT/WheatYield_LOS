# WheatYield_LOS
This anslysis is to evaluate the effects of wheat yield in the case of loss of industry (LoS). With the data in hand, we analyzed the 8 input variables (nitrogen, phosphate fertilizer, mechanized, irrigiantion, soil, temperature, moist,and pesticide) effects on wheat yield. 
We used machine learning methods (random forest and neural network) to explore the variable importance, and predict for the yield under loss of industry.
